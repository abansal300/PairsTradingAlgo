I built an automated pairs trading algorithm that identifies when two correlated stocks temporarily diverge—like Eli Lilly and Amgen—and trades on that divergence.

The system uses historical data to calculate a statistical spread and z-scores to detect when that spread becomes unusually wide. When that happens, it automatically goes long one stock and short the other, betting they'll converge back. 

Before trading live, it runs a grid search optimization to find the best entry and exit thresholds. I've also built in risk management with stop-losses, position sizing, and slippage calculations. The algorithm runs continuously during market hours using the Alpaca API, currently in paper trading mode for safe testing before going live with real money.
